# Getting Started
### Clone the repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/CKPatil/Kirana-web-app.git
$ cd Kirana-web-app
```

### Install npm packages

Make sure you have the **Angular CLI** installed globally. We use npm to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it.
Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```sh
$ npm install 
$ ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/.` The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
